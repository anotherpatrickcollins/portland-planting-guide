      Thanks for coming to my little tool! I built it out of a selfish need as a Portland gardener, as every year I find myself pouring over the Portland Nursery’s Veggie Calendar pamphlet trying to decipher the exact information I need at the time. Is it too late to plant squash seeds outdoors? Should I do starts instead? When do I need to flip crops to get my fall harvest going? 
      <br />
      I love that guide, however the layout of information just did not work for my brain to take in. So I decided to type it all into a spreadsheet, and then decided to make that spreadsheet power a tiny little lookup, and then decided to make that lookup look kinda nice and share it with all of you. 
      <br />
      So big thanks to the Portland Nursery for compiling information from their references - The Maritime Northwest Garden Guide by Seattle Tilth, The Old Farmer’s Almanac, Territorial Seed Catalogue, and Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades by Steve Solomon - and sharing that with us Portlanders. I hope this interface makes it just a bit more accessible for those that are looking for it.
