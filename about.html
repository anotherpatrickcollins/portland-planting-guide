      Thanks for coming to my little tool! I built it out of a selfish need as a Portland gardener, as every year I find myself pouring over the <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/docs/veggies/VeggieCalendar.pdf" class="text-pink-500 underline text-sm font-medium hover:text-black self-center">Portland Nursery’s Veggie Calendar</a> pamphlet trying to decipher the exact information I need at the time. Is it too late to plant squash seeds outdoors? Should I do starts instead? When do I need to flip crops to get my fall harvest going? 
    </p>

      I love that guide, however the layout of information just did not work for my brain to take in. So I decided to type it all into a spreadsheet, and then decided to make that spreadsheet power a tiny little lookup, and then decided to make that lookup look kinda nice and share it with all of you. 
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-sm font-mono">
      So big thanks to the Portland Nursery for compiling information from their references - <em>The Maritime Northwest Garden Guide</em> by Seattle Tilth, The Old Farmer’s Almanac, Territorial Seed Catalogue, and <em>Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades</em> by Steve Solomon - and sharing that with us Portlanders. I hope this interface makes it just a bit more accessible for those that are looking for it.
